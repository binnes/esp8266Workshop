# Part 4

!!! note
    This part of the workshop can be completed without a real device using the Watson IoT Platform device simulator.  Instructions on how to use the simulator are included in this project [here](../Simulator/README.md)

## Introduction to Watson Studio

This section shows you how to deploy the Watson Studio service and how to create your first Jupyter Notebook.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Watson Studio**](STUDIO.md)

## Create training data

This section shows you how to create the training data needed to create a model so you will be able to determine what is happening from the sensor data.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Training Data**](TRAINING.md)

## Jupyter Notebook Analytics - Create model

This section shows you how to use the training data to create a model that can then be used to classify actions.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Jupyter Notebook - ESP8266**](JUPYTER.md)

## Run the model on the ESP8266 device

This section takes the output from the Jupyter Notebook and implements the trained model on the ESP8266 device.

- Estimated duration: 20 min
- practical [**Implement model on ESP8266**](MODEL.md)

## Workshop summary

This section summarises what the workshop covered and also provides some useful links for further exploration of IoT and Data Science

- Estimated duration: 10 min
