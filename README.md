# Welcome to the ESP8266 IoT Workshop

IoT workshop based on ESP8266, a DHT11/22 and NeoPixel RGB LED

This version of the workshop uses the IBM Cloud IoT Platform as the MQTT broker.  The workshop has since been upgraded to use a different MQTT service.

There is also a downloadable PDF containing the instructions for this version of the workshop [here](https://binnes.github.io/esp8266Workshop/pdf/esp8266Workshop.pdf)

## Updating content

The workshop instructions are hosted on GitHub pages and are automatically generated from the Markdown in the docs folder of this repo.

The site is automatically regenerated when a **push** or **pull request** is made to the **master** branch of this GitHub repository.  

A GitHub Action, which is configured by the .github folder in this repository, runs the commands to update the documentation site.
